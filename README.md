MRI Brain Tumor XAI
MRI-Brain-Tumor-XAI is a deep learning-based project designed for accurate classification of brain tumors using MRI images, enhanced with explainable AI (XAI) techniques. It combines CNN architectures with visualization tools like Grad-CAM to interpret and highlight tumor regions, supporting clinical decision-making through transparency and trust in model predictions.
